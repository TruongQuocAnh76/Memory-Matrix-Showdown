## Project Overview

This project is a data structure and algorithm implementation created by a team of four students. The project revolves around a game called "Memory Matrix Showdown."

## Game Description

Memory Matrix Showdown is an engaging and challenging game where players must test their memory and strategic skills. The gameplay involves a random array appearing on the screen within 3 to 5 seconds. The player's objective is to remember the sequence of numbers and quickly fill in the blank array displayed below.

Here are the key aspects of the game:

    - Objective: Fill in the blank array with the correct sequence of numbers.

    - Challenge: You have a limited time (3 - 5 seconds) to memorize the random array.

    - Consequences: If you fill in the array incorrectly, your health will be deducted. However, if you fill it in correctly, the monster's health will be deducted. The amount of health deducted is equal to the number of elements you entered incorrectly.

    - Progression: Successfully passing a round results in an increase in the number of elements in the array and the monster's health.
